I opened the eclipse in my local system and I created a DTD file and XML file
These two files contains JRE System library and src in each of them where we further create the files and write the code
In DTD file, we created an XML file and the parser source code file is named as DomParserDTD as it is for DTD. 
Here we write the code and execute the files
I made some modifications depending on the errors I got and the output I’m expecting
In XML file, we created an XML file and a XSD file by giving the extensions as .xml and .xsd and the parser source code file is named as DomParserSchema as it is a schema for the XML file which we need to execute by giving the required data which executed through the schema
Here I changed the names of the file and tags accordingly to get the expected output. Finally, I got the output I’m expecting and uploaded the code to github
